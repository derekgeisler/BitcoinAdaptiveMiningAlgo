Bitcoin Adaptive Mining Algorithm

A simplified example of a Bitcoin miner using an adaptive algorithm. This example will be more of a conceptual demonstration rather than a fully optimized mining solution.

Key Components of a Bitcoin Miner

Hashing Algorithm: Bitcoin uses SHA-256 hashing.

Adaptive Algorithm: The miner will adjust its hashing difficulty dynamically based on the current network difficulty.
Networking: Communication with Bitcoin nodes to fetch the latest block and submit mined solutions.


Prerequisites:

Install Python and required libraries.

`pip install hashlib requests`
